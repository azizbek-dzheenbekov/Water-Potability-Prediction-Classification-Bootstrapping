# Water-Potability-Prediction-Classification-task

This Jupyter notebook aims to predict whether a water sample is safe for consumption based on its chemical composition. The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle and can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability).

Access to safe drinking-water is a crucial aspect of public health and an essential human right. This notebook showcases how machine learning techniques can help in identifying safe drinking water sources by classifying water samples into potable or non-potable.

The notebook explores different machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, KNN, and Support Vector Classifier to predict the potability of water samples. It also handles missing data and checks for data imbalance to ensure the accuracy of the predictions.

Technologies used in this project include Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.
